## Introduction to Probability

Status: Auditing

Welcome to STAT110x: Introduction to Probability! We hope you enjoy the course, and learn a lot about how to think about randomness and uncertainty. This course has seven units of content, after Unit 0's short introduction and orientation. For each of these seven units, the structure is as follows:

    First, we set the stage with an animation taking place in the realm of Statland.
    Next, there are readings adapted from the book Introduction to Probability by Joe Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang.
    After the reading, there are one or more interactives, designed to allow you to experiment with some concepts from the unit, through a visualization or simulation.
    Solving problems is essential for learning probability well, so each unit also contains practice problems and homework problems (see the syllabus for information about the distinction between these two types of problems).
    Asking questions when you are stuck will help you learn. We have included opportunities for you to get help from your peers and the course team or discuss the material in the discussion forums.
