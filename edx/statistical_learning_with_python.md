## Statistical Learning with Python

Status: Auditing

Welcome to the updated version of Statistical Learning, featuring Deep Learning, Survival Analysis and Multiple Testing!

Your learning adventure with Trevor, Rob and their team begins today.

This self-paced course follows closely the sequence of chapters in the course text "An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R (Second Edition)" (James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani - Springer 2021). This textbook is available at https://www.statlearning.com/.

Sections are broken up by chapters. The first two sections will be an overview of Statistical Learning, and will cover the first two chapters of the book. All materials are available now, but the schedule below provides you with a recommendation for how to approach the content.

This course has been updated from its original version, adding material in the second edition of the course text. There are new lectures on Deep Learning, Survival Analysis and Multiple Testing. The latter topic features a guest lecture by Gareth James and Daniela Witten.

Section 1: Introduction
Section 2: Overview of Statistical Learning
Section 3: Linear Regression
Section 4: Classification
Section 5: Resampling Methods
Section 6: Linear Model Selection and Regularization
Section 7: Moving Beyond Linearity
Section 8: Tree-based Methods
Section 9: Support Vector Machines
Section 10: Deep Learning
Section 11: Survival Anlysis and Censored Data
Section 12: Unsupervised Learning
Section 13: Multiple Testing

To see the course materials, click on the "Start Course" button, or click on the links to content in the outline below. Within a given subsection, you can move from one unit to the next by clicking the next icons, which appear at the top and bottom of each page. The sequence of sections, subsections, and units is intended to be experienced in order.

Versions of the class videos are available for download. If you look under any section's video, you will see a "Download video" button. If you click that, you can download and save the video on your device. These are not as high resolution as the class video, but if you also download the pdf slides for each chapter, you should be fine.

It's a pleasure to have you as part of the course. Enjoy the journey!
