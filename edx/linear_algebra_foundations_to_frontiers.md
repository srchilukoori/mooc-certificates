## Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers

Status: Auditing

LAFF is self-paced, which means there are no deadlines until the course ends in December.

In this course, you will learn all the standard topics that are taught in typical undergraduate linear algebra courses all over the world, but using our unique method, you'll also get more! LAFF was developed following the syllabus of an introductory linear algebra course at The University of Texas at Austin taught by Professor Robert van de Geijn, an expert on high performance linear algebra libraries. Through short videos, exercises, visualizations, and programming assignments, you will study Vector and Matrix Operations, Linear Transformations, Solving Systems of Equations, Vector Spaces, Linear Least-Squares, and Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. In addition, you will get a glimpse of cutting edge research on the development of linear algebra libraries, which are used throughout computational science.

Our materials are organized into "Weeks." Week 0 is designed to help you set up and explains how to navigate the course. Course content starts in Week 1.

Let us answer a few frequently asked questions:

    I am new to edX. How do I navigate a course? If this is your first experience with an edX course and you want to find out more about the platform, you may want to enroll in the demo course at https://www.edx.org/course/demox.

    Will the course be using Matlab or some other software? Is it possible to do the course in Python or R? The programming is meant to support the learning of linear algebra. What language is used is not important to the learning, and hence you should use MATLAB, since that is what we will be supporting. In fact, you will find out that we have created a "domain specific language" (DSL) on top of MATLAB. What we mean by a "domain specific language" and how we use it in the course will become clear in Week 1. We created a similar DSL for Python and used IPython Notebooks for the first offering in 2014. These are still available from http://www.ulaff.net , but are no longer supported. Since we haven't created the DSL for R, using R is not a good fit for this course. For the most part, you will not be using the built-in matrix operations provided as part of MATLAB. Instead, you will be discovering and implementing your own algorithms.

    Do you teach some MATLAB syntax along with the course? Just enough for you to get by. This is not a course on how to program in MATLAB. But you can explore MATLAB tutorials offered by MathWorks on your own to learn the language better.

    Are students given a free license for MATLAB valid for the duration of the course? Yes

    Is it necessary to buy the LAFF book from ulaff.net or lulu.com? No. We link to PDFs for each week of notes as part of the edX course. These PDFs are hyperlinked to the units on the edX platform so that you can conveniently navigate between the notes and the online course.


    LAFF long and prosper!
