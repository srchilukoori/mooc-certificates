Specialization: [https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/R45GHXBWRNKQ](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/R45GHXBWRNKQ)


### Algebra and Differential Calculus for Data Science
#### 1 of 3 of Expressway to Data Science: Essential Math Specialization

This course will teach you the most fundamental Calculus concepts that you will need for a career in Data Science without a ton of unnecessary proofs and techniques that you may never use. Consider this an expressway to Data Science with approachable methods and friendly concepts that will guide you to truly understanding the most important ideas in Differential Calculus.  We will review some algebra basics, talk about what a derivative is, compute some simple derivatives and apply the basics of derivatives to graphing and maximizing functions.

This course is designed to prepare learners to successfully complete Statistical Modeling for Data Science Application, which is part of CU Boulder's Master of Science in Data Science (MS-DS) program.

Topics include:
- Functions and Algebra Review
- Induction Proofs, Limits and Continuity
- Definition of a Derivative
- Product and Chain Rule
- Using Derivatives to Graph Functions
- Finding Maximums and Minimums
